This project is to test  the possibility of STM32F407VGT6 microcontroller peripherals

using STM32F4DISCOVERY kit.

USART Driver for STM32F407 using CMSIS library is implemented.

If enabled, the USART driver uses the DMA module channels or Ring buffer.



# CMSIS-Driver configuration

There are multiple ways to configure a CMSIS-Driver.


## Via the RTE_Device.h file

The classical method is using the *RTE_Device.h* file that comes with the device support. The 

file configures the drivers to the actual pin connection of the microcontroller device. 

Using the *Configuration Wizard* view of *RTE_Device.h*, it can configure the driver 

interfaces in a graphical mode without the need to edit manually the #defines in this 

header file. 


## Via STM32CubeMX

The next method is  CMSIS-Driver configuring using **STM32CubeMX**. This graphical software 

configuration tool allows you to generate C initialization code using graphical wizards 

for STMicroelectronics devices.

## This Project

The use of *STM32Cube Framework* and  *STM32 HAL library* is not intended in the Project.

The classical method via the *RTE_Device.h* file and the *Configuration Wizard* is applied.

Further the #defines in *RTE_Device.h* file is manually used in Driver files.
